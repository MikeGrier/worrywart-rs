# Copilot Instructions

Use CRLF line endings.

## Line endings in tool parameters

All text content passed to tpu tools (`content`, `replacement`, `data` in edit ops) is
automatically normalized to LF before processing. You do not need to worry about whether
the text you send uses LF or CRLF — tpu handles the conversion. The file's existing
line-ending convention (LF or CRLF) is preserved on disk automatically.

## Terminal / Git rules — hang prevention

**These rules prevent terminal hangs that freeze the session.**

- Every `git` command that can produce paged output **must** be run with
  `git --no-pager <subcommand>`. The list below is illustrative, not exhaustive:
  `diff`, `show`, `log`, `blame`, `reflog`, `stash list`, `branch -v`,
  `shortlog`, `tag -n`, `whatchanged`, `grep`. **If unsure whether a `git`
  subcommand may page, use `--no-pager`.**
- Never run `git commit` without `-m "…"`. Commit messages must be a **single
  line** when supplied via `-m`. For longer messages write the message to a
  file under `.scratch/` and use `git commit -F .scratch/<file>`. Never use
  PowerShell here-strings (`@"…"@`) or embedded newlines inside `-m` —
  PowerShell will either hang waiting for terminator or pass `\n` literally.
- **Rust pre-commit gate:** If any staged file has a `.rs` extension, you
  **must** run `cargo fmt` then `cargo clippy --all-targets` (via the
  `mcp_cargo-mcp_cargo_fmt` and `mcp_cargo-mcp_cargo_clippy` tools) and fix
  all issues before running `git commit`. Any issue reported by either tool
  must be resolved before continuing — do not proceed to `git commit` while
  any formatting diff or Clippy diagnostic remains. See the full gate in
  `.github/instructions/global.rust.instructions.md`.
- Never run `git pull` or `git merge` without `--no-edit`.
- Never run interactive commands: `git rebase -i`, `git add -p`, etc.
- Do not use `less`, `more`, or any other interactive pager.
- Never use PowerShell multi-line string operators (`@"…"@`) in terminal commands.

## Cargo commands — use cargo-mcp tools, never the terminal

Always use the `cargo_*` MCP tools instead of running `cargo` commands in a terminal.
This applies even inside a larger workflow — do not switch to the terminal for cargo
just because a previous step used the terminal.

| MCP tool | Replaces |
|---|---|
| `cargo_metadata` | `cargo metadata` |
| `cargo_check` | `cargo check` |
| `cargo_build` | `cargo build` |
| `cargo_test` | `cargo test` |
| `cargo_clippy` | `cargo clippy` |
| `cargo_fmt_check` | `cargo fmt --check` |
| `cargo_fmt` | `cargo fmt` |
| `cargo_tree` | `cargo tree` |
| `cargo_doc` | `cargo doc` |
| `cargo_clean` | `cargo clean` |
| `cargo_update` | `cargo update` |
| `cargo_fix` | `cargo fix` |
| `cargo_add` | `cargo add` |
| `cargo_remove` | `cargo remove` |
| `cargo_publish` | `cargo publish` |
| `cargo_setup` | *(no terminal equivalent)* |
| `cargo_diagnostic` | *(no terminal equivalent)* |

### cargo_test — timeout

When launched by the VS Code extension, `cargo_test` applies a server-side
default timeout from the `cargo-mcp.test.timeoutSecs` setting (**30 seconds**
by default). Without the extension (or with `cargo-mcp.test.timeoutSecs: 0`),
the server has no default timeout. The budget covers only test **execution** —
the clock starts when compilation and linking finish (cargo's `build-finished`
record), so a slow build never trips the timeout.

- Omit `timeout_secs` to let the server default apply.
- Pass `timeout_secs: N` to use a specific budget for this run.
- Pass `timeout_secs: 0` to disable the timeout for this run, regardless of
  the server default.

The budget covers only test **execution** — the clock starts when
compilation and linking finish (cargo's `build-finished` record), so a slow
build never trips the timeout. Raise it (or pass `0`) for runs you know are
slow (long integration suites, a single test that sleeps/polls); lower it
when sanity-checking a fix and you want fast feedback if a change spun into
an infinite loop.

### Per-call environment variables (`env`)

Every `cargo_*` tool that spawns cargo accepts an optional `env` object that
sets or unsets environment variables on the cargo subprocess for that one
call. Keys are env var names; values are a string (set) or `null` (unset).
The map layers on top of cargo-mcp's defaults (`CARGO_TERM_COLOR`,
`NO_COLOR`, `RUSTC`), so a caller-supplied value wins.

Use this — never a terminal — to apply a one-shot debug knob such as
`RUSTFLAGS`, `RUST_LOG`, `RUST_BACKTRACE`, `RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP`, or a
compiler-internal dump like `FIREBIRD_DUMP_MIR`:

```json
{ "env": { "FIREBIRD_DUMP_MIR": "1", "RUST_BACKTRACE": "1" } }
```

Do **not** use `env` for permanent/project-wide config (put that in
`Cargo.toml`, `.cargo/config.toml`, or `rust-toolchain.toml`) or for
secrets (the block is visible via OS process inspection).

### Redirecting full output to a file (`output_path`)

`cargo_check`, `cargo_build`, `cargo_test`, `cargo_clippy`, and `cargo_doc`
accept an optional `output_path`: a relative path (under the working
directory; no `..`; parent must already exist) that receives the **complete**
NDJSON output. When set, the tool result is a compact SUMMARY (invocation
header, an `x-cargo-mcp-output-file` pointer, all `level: error` messages,
`build-finished`, stderr, status trailer, and — for `cargo_test` — libtest
summary/failure markers); warnings, passing-test lines, artifact records, and
captured `println!` replays are dropped from the summary but preserved in the
file.

Use `output_path` when the full transcript would bloat context (long
`cargo_test` runs, large workspaces) instead of piping to a temp file. Per
the scratch-directory rule below, target `.scratch/` (e.g.
`".scratch/test-run.ndjson"`). Read the summary first; if `exit_code` is
non-zero or failure markers appear, open the file for the full transcript.

### Reading cargo_test output

`cargo_test` returns a strict NDJSON stream. Parse it line-by-line; every
non-blank line is a JSON object. The `reason` field identifies the record type:

| `reason` | Content | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `x-cargo-mcp-invocation` | Effective command and working dir (first line) | `argv`, `cwd` |
| `compiler-message` | Compilation error or warning | `message` (rustc diagnostic) |
| `build-finished` | Build phase outcome | `success` (bool) |
| `x-cargo-mcp-test-output` | One line of libtest harness output or captured `println!` | `text` |
| `x-cargo-mcp-stderr` | `eprintln!` and other test stderr (when non-empty) | `text` |
| *(last line)* | Exit status | `status` (`"success"` or `"error"`), `exit_code` (on error) |

`println!` inside tests is captured by libtest and replayed as
`x-cargo-mcp-test-output` lines only when the test fails (standard libtest
behaviour). `eprintln!` bypasses libtest capture and always appears in
`x-cargo-mcp-stderr`.

## Scratch directory for temporary files

When you need to capture command output, test results, debug logs, build warnings, or any
other temporary/diagnostic data to a file, **always write it under the `.scratch/` directory**
at the repository root. This directory is git-ignored.

- Create `.scratch/` if it does not exist.
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `.scratch/test_parser_output.txt`, `.scratch/build_warnings.txt`).
- **Never** write scratch or debug files to the repository root or any source directory.

## General instructions for this repository
- All source code should include a copyright statement. The statement should be brief, a single line comment as the first line of the file which reads something like: Copyright (c) Michael Grier.
- If the source file is also part of an open source library, there may be additional lines giving the details, but in general, open source content should not be checked in to this source repository except as part of a patching process to provide a patch over defective open source dependencies which have to be addressed for security or business continuity reasons.

## Interaction Guidelines
- Prefer concise responses: minimize verbosity, reduce repetition, and avoid excessive formatting/emojis. Get straight to the point in all interactions.

## Checklist execution discipline

When executing checklist items (CHECKLIST.md files):

- **One item at a time.** Implement exactly one checklist item, then **stop and commit**, then move on. "Stop" means: do not begin reading, planning, or editing for the next item until the current one's commit has succeeded.
- **A checklist item may legitimately be large.** "One item, one commit" is a sequencing rule, **not** a commit-size rule. There is no upper bound on the diff size, file count, or scope of a single item's commit. If an item's work is genuinely coupled — for example, an IR-schema change that requires updates across lowering, codegen, freezer, pretty-printer, and tests to compile at all — do the whole thing in one commit. Do **not** invent sub-items (`M1.1.1`, `M1.1.2`, …) to make the commit feel smaller; that is artificial work that violates the "one item, one commit" rule by turning one item into several.
- **If items are mis-structured, say so; do not paper over it.** If you discover during execution that two checklist items cannot be implemented independently (one cannot compile or pass tests without the other), that is a checklist-structuring defect. Be honest: name the defect, then either (a) commit both items together in one commit referencing both IDs (acknowledged defect), or (b) restructure the checklist first (in its own commit) so the items become independent. Do **not** silently split, tease apart, or interleave commits to disguise the coupling.
- **No batching for convenience.** Do not implement, edit, or stage changes for item N+1 until item N is committed *just because* the work is similar, the context is loaded, or it feels efficient to do both at once. Convenience, similarity, or shared context across adjacent items is **not** sufficient justification to batch.
- **Re-plan when execution reveals planning was wrong.** A checklist is a hopeful projection, not a contract. When execution surfaces information that invalidates the plan — items that turn out to be coupled, an item that decomposes into work the original plan didn't anticipate, an item that turns out to already be done, an item whose scope expands or contracts based on what you now know — **stop and update the checklist before continuing.** Restructuring a checklist mid-execution is normal and expected; pretending the original plan was correct and silently working around it is not. The restructure itself is a commit (with a message explaining what new information forced the change), and then the revised plan governs.
- **If items must be done together, say so and do it; don't tease apart.** Once you have decided (and recorded in the checklist if the structure is wrong) that two items must land together, commit them together in one commit citing both IDs. Do **not** try to "unthread" a coupled implementation into per-item commits after the fact — that is fiction, not history.
- **Commit immediately after each item.** The commit must happen before moving to the next item.
- **Commit message format:** `Completed item: <item-id>: <full item text>` (e.g. `Completed item: SF-1: Add extensible FunctionCall variant to FilterExpr`).
- **Check the item off** in CHECKLIST.md (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`) and include that change in the same commit.
- After the commit, pull / rebase from origin then push back to origin
- **Tests must pass** before committing. Run the appropriate test command (per the language-specific instructions) after each item and fix failures before committing. Pre-existing failures unrelated to the current item do not block the commit, but must be recorded in `UNRESOLVED-TEST-FAILURES.md` (see language-specific instructions for the convention) before committing.
- **When the last item in a CHECKLIST file is completed**, update its PLANS.md entry to "completed" in the same commit.
- **Cross-component handoff callouts.** When the next required action in a checklist sequence shifts to a different source-component (see "Source-Components" above) — i.e. the next dependency-ordered item cannot be worked in the current component because it lives in another component — the item whose completion triggers the shift must end with an explicit handoff callout naming the destination component, milestone, and work item ID. Use the reciprocal form on the destination side: the destination's first dependent item must carry a `CROSS-COMPONENT PREREQUISITE` callout naming the source component / item that must land first, and (if control returns) a `CROSS-COMPONENT HANDOFF` callout at the end pointing back. Recommended format (markdown blockquote so it stands out when scanning):
  > **➡ CROSS-COMPONENT HANDOFF:** next work is in component `<component-path>` → `<milestone-id>` → `<work-item-id>` (`<short title>`). See [`<path-to-CHECKLIST.md>`](...).
  The goal is that a reader executing a checklist linearly never has to infer cross-component dependencies from surrounding prose — the boundary is always called out at the exact item where the handoff occurs.

## Coding conventions

### No manifest numeric constants in source code

Never write bare integer or byte literals as discriminants or protocol tags inline in logic code.
Instead, use **either** a named `#[repr(u8)]` enum **or** a `mod` of typed `const` values, and use
those named identifiers everywhere — in match arms, `vec![]` pushes, assertions, and doc tables.
Both approaches are acceptable; consistency within a single file or module is what matters.

**Bad:**
```rust
v.push(4u8);   // what is 4?
vec![255u8]    // magic
assert_eq!(key, vec![0u8]);
```

**Good (enum approach):**
```rust
#[repr(u8)]
enum ValueKeyTag { DbNull = 0, Text = 4, Err = 255, ... }

v.push(ValueKeyTag::Text as u8);
vec![ValueKeyTag::Err as u8]
assert_eq!(key, vec![ValueKeyTag::DbNull as u8]);
```

**Good (const approach):**
```rust
mod tags {
    pub const DBNULL: u8 = 0;
    pub const TEXT:   u8 = 4;
    pub const ERR:    u8 = 255;
}

v.push(tags::TEXT);
vec![tags::ERR]
assert_eq!(key, vec![tags::DBNULL]);
```

This rule applies to all binary encoding schemes, wire protocols, file format tags, sort-key type
bytes, and any other place where a numeric value carries identity meaning. The enum or const module
is defined in the same file or module as the logic that uses it, and its doc comment must note that
changing any value is a breaking change.

## Design Autonomy — Behavior is owned, never inherited from dependencies

We **define** our behavior. We **choose** dependencies that can satisfy our definition.

It is never acceptable to describe our behavior as "whatever crate X does" or "we delegate to
library Y." That framing surrenders our autonomy to decide what is correct for our users and makes
it impossible to reason about correctness, versioning risk, or future migration.

The correct framing is always:
1. State **what our specified behavior is** (inputs we accept, outputs we produce, errors we raise).
2. Note **which dependency is used to achieve it** and that the dependency was chosen because its
   behavior matches our specification.
3. If a dependency's actual behavior diverges from our specification, the dependency is wrong,
   not our specification. We either constrain the dependency, wrap it, or replace it.

We may align our specification with a dependency's behavior when that behavior is sensible for our
users — but the specification must still be written down explicitly and owned by us. When a
dependency is upgraded or replaced, our specification does not change; only the implementation does.

This applies everywhere: file formats, parse rules, error messages, wire protocols, encoding choices.

## Mono-repo bug policy — fix the layer, don't work around it

All crates in this repository are under active development. When work in one component
reveals a bug or deficiency in an underlying layer (another crate in the repo), **fix it
at the source** rather than working around it in the consuming crate. The whole point of
the mono-repo is that we own every layer and can change them together.

If the fix demands significant refactoring that would derail the current task, raise the
issue back to the engineer driving forward progress so we can decide together whether to
fix it now or defer it. But the default is always: fix the bug where it lives.

## Source-Components

- Source-Components are directory hierarchies in the repository rooted at some directory.
- Source-Components are identified by the presence of either a Cargo.toml file or a COMPONENT.md file in the directory.
- The root of the repository contains a Cargo.toml file, so the entire repository is a source-component, but there are also smaller source-components within the repository which may have their own Cargo.toml or COMPONENT.md files.

Examples:
- `src/tools/csv/` (has COMPONENT.md)
- `src/tools/csv/csv/` (has Cargo.toml)

## Always plan
- Always form a plan in the form of a CHECKLIST.md, at the lowest common source-component for the change
- Keep the plan up to date as you execute on the plan
- Keep a file at the root of each component, called PLANS.md, which tracks all the CHECKLIST.md files in the repository and their status (not started, in progress, completed). If it does not exist, create it. If it does exist, update it with the new CHECKLIST.md file and its status.
- When a CHECKLIST.md file is completed, move it to a table in a different file called COMPLETED-PLANS.md in the same directory, with a brief summary of the work completed, and remove it from PLANS.md.



PLANS.md format (markdown table):
| Path to CHECKLIST.md | Status | Brief description | Design Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

COMPLETED-PLANS.md format (markdown table):
| Path to CHECKLIST.md | Completion Date | Brief description | Design Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

Status values: "not started", "in progress", "completed"

Design Notes column: Path(s) to DESIGN-NOTES.md file(s) that document the work, or "N/A" if none exist

## Plan sizing

If a plan exceeds roughly 10 work items or 3 levels of grouping/nesting, checkpoint it
into a CHECKLIST.md file in the repository before continuing. The goal is that the plan
survives a lost session — if the plan only exists in the chat, it will be lost.

## Design notes are not a work queue

Design notes (DESIGN-NOTES.md, DESIGN-RATIONALE.md, and related files) record *decisions*
— what was chosen and why. They steer future work, but they do **not** schedule it. The
only mechanism that queues work on existing code is a CHECKLIST.md item. A decision that is
recorded only in a design note, with the work it implies never transcribed into a checklist
item, is effectively orphaned: nothing will ever cause that work to be picked up.

This matters because the repository is worked by multiple people and multiple automated
agent sessions, often in parallel and on different machines. None of them share local or
session-private memory. The only directive any contributor — human or agent — can rely on
seeing is what is committed to the repository. Therefore work must be queued in committed
CHECKLIST.md files, never parked in an agent's memory, a chat thread, or a design note that
no one is obligated to act on.

When recording a decision that implies a change to existing code:

- In the same change that records the decision, ensure the implied work exists as a
  CHECKLIST.md item (creating or updating the checklist as needed), and reference the
  decision from that item so the two can be traced to each other.
- If a decision deliberately schedules **no** work — a reservation, a deferral, or a
  "leave as-is for now" choice — state that explicitly in the decision so the absence of a
  checklist item is visibly intentional rather than an oversight.

A component may layer additional, stricter conventions on top of this rule (for example, a
required cross-reference syntax between decision IDs and checklist items). Follow the
nearest applicable component instructions in addition to this baseline.

## CHECKLIST file hygiene

CHECKLIST files are **action-only**: they contain pending, in-progress, and recently
completed (`[x]`) items awaiting migration to `COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md`. Completed items
must be moved to `COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md` when a group is fully done (see below).
Never leave historical records, prose summaries, rationale, or context in a CHECKLIST file.

Checklists for work more than 2-3 items long should be organized into milestones.
Milestones should generally be sized to about 5 work items (suggestion, not a rule) and
should end with integration tests when possible.

At the end of every milestone, the following steps are **implicit** and must NOT be written
as checklist items:

1. **Clean compile (no warnings) of the default workspace, both debug and release.**
   "Clean" means: discard prior build artifacts first, then build, so that all warnings
   are re-emitted (not suppressed by incremental caching). Fix **all** warnings that
   appear, even those unrelated to the milestone's changes. The exact commands depend on
   the language toolchain — see the language-specific instructions for the mapping (for
   Rust this is `cargo clean` followed by `cargo check --all-targets` and
   `cargo check --all-targets --release`,
   per [instructions/global.rust.instructions.md](instructions/global.rust.instructions.md)).

   **Scope = the default workspace, NOT every member.** "The default workspace" is the
   set of crates the build tool selects when given no explicit package/scope flag (for
   Cargo: the `default-members` list). Some members are deliberately **excluded** from
   the default set because they are expensive to build (for example, a crate with a
   large LALRPOP/codegen build script) — those exclusions are intentional and must be
   respected.

   **Do NOT broaden the scope to all members.** For Cargo specifically: run plain
   `cargo check --all-targets` (which honors `default-members`). **Never add
   `--workspace`** (nor enumerate every package with repeated `-p`) for a
   milestone-boundary build — doing so overrides `default-members`, drags in the
   intentionally-excluded slow crates, and has previously caused builds to appear to
   hang. `--all-targets` (tests/examples/benches) is fine and expected; `--workspace`
   (all members) is not.
2. **Test only the in-scope crate / source-component**, not the whole default workspace.
3. **Sync with origin**: `git fetch`, then merge or rebase the current branch on top
   of the updated upstream tip (`--no-edit`), resolving any conflicts, then push.
   Pushing is permitted at milestone boundaries without further confirmation; outside
   milestone boundaries, follow the standard "ask before pushing" rule.

These are standard procedure, not work items. Checklists contain only substantive work.

Work items in a milestone must be self-contained and all work items must be in dependency order.

### Sub-step notation

When a checklist step is broken into sub-steps, always use decimal notation: `RC-1.1`, `RC-1.2`,
`RC-1.3`, etc. (or whatever prefix is in use). Never use lettered sub-items (`RC-1a`, `RC-1b`) or
nested bullet lists to represent sub-steps. This applies both to CHECKLIST files and to any inline
step breakdowns described during planning.

When a group of related items is fully complete:
1. Move the completed group to `COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md` in the same directory.
2. Prefix the moved block with a heading: `## Moved YYYY-MM-DD — <brief description of what was done>`.
3. `COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md` is **append-only**; always add new groups at the bottom.
4. Leave only the remaining pending or in-progress items in the source `CHECKLIST.md`.

Named feature files (`CHECKLIST-<feature>.md`) should be **deleted entirely** once all items are
complete. Move their content to `COMPLETED-CHECKLIST.md` in the same directory before deleting.

## Design note files

Any directory in the repository may have a DESIGN-NOTES.md file.

The DESIGN-NOTES.md file should record design decisions about the code in that directory and its children.

If a decision should be recorded, it should be recorded in a DESIGN-NOTES.md file. The DESIGN-NOTES.md
file to use is either the DESIGN-NOTES.md file in the source-component directory which should be created
if it does not already exist, or if there is an already existing DESIGN-NOTES.md file in any ancestor
directory between the file being changed and the source-component root, use that one instead.

### What to include

The design note files should include anything that a future developer should or may want to know about the
code to help them "get up to speed" or diagnose interesting or bad behaviors.

### What not to include

Like with code comments, don't include super obvious things.

Example: A query processor design note must describe its intent and unique approach in a paragraph, not provide a comprehensive tutorial on the underlying technology or theory. It may include links to external resources for further reading, but should not attempt to teach the reader about query processing in general.

### Three-tier design documentation

Source-components with substantial design history should separate current decisions from
historical rationale using three tiers:

- **Tier 1: `DESIGN-NOTES.md`** — Current canonical decisions. Contains decision indexes,
  compact detail sections stating what was decided and why. Every paragraph must answer
  "what is the decision?" or "what constraint forced this choice?" — not "what else did
  we consider?" Content that answers the latter belongs in Tier 2.

- **Tier 2: `DESIGN-RATIONALE.md`** — Historical record of how decisions were reached.
  Alternatives considered, prior art, design session summaries, evolutionary reasoning.
  Cross-referenced by decision ID from Tier 1. This file is consulted for "why" questions,
  not for forward implementation work.

- **Tier 3: `design-sessions/DESIGN-SESSION-<date>-<topic>.md`** — Raw design session
  transcripts, dated by session. Reference material, not routinely loaded. Stored in a
  `design-sessions/` subdirectory under the source-component root.

When recording a new decision, write to both Tier 1 and Tier 2 in the same commit.
**Never treat Tier 2 or Tier 3 as authoritative for current decisions.** If there is a
conflict, Tier 1 wins.

A source-component may have a `DESIGN-INSTRUCTIONS.md` file specifying additional design
rules — including how these tiers are used — for that component and everything below it.
When working in a directory, locate and follow the nearest `DESIGN-INSTRUCTIONS.md` in
that directory or any ancestor up to the source-component root. These directives are
binding for all work under that directory.

Not all source-components need all three tiers. Small components may have only DESIGN-NOTES.md.

### Design session files

When a design conversation produces extended discussion, exploration, or working-through of a
topic — beyond what fits in a Tier 2 rationale section — capture it as a design session file.

**When to create a session file:**
- The conversation explores a topic in depth over multiple exchanges
- The discussion covers alternatives, trade-offs, or implications that would be valuable
  context for a future reader trying to understand the design landscape
- The topic warrants a standalone record beyond the decision summary in DESIGN-RATIONALE.md

**Naming:** `DESIGN-SESSION-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic-slug>.md` (e.g.,
`DESIGN-SESSION-2026-04-06-task-floating.md`)

**Location:** `design-sessions/` subdirectory under the source-component root. Create the
directory if it does not exist. This prevents session files from accumulating in the
component's top-level directory.

**Content:** The session file should be a faithful record of the design discussion — the
reasoning, alternatives, and conclusions as they unfolded. It does not need to be polished
prose, but should be readable by a future developer. Include a brief summary at the top
noting which decisions (D-numbers) resulted from the session.

### Historical Record

As features age out of a source-component, at the very least, move notes which are no longer relevant to a
different file, DESIGN-NOTES-AGED-OUT.md.

When moving the section to DESIGN-NOTES-AGED-OUT.md, include the date of the move, in YYYY/MM/DD format.

## Quality

When providing testing, always provide extensive testing to test at least 10 normal cases, as well as all identifiable edge cases, unless the
computation required to test the edge cases would be excessive on a modern system. The unit tests for a submodule should be able to complete
in under one second of elapsed time on an AMD Ryzen R7 processor running at 1.5ghz with 16gb of memory.

If there are tests which seem vital that would take longer, put an item in a CHECKLIST.md file with special importance for the user to
decide on whether to include them or not.

In any case, if the test is vital it must be authored and be run as part of the integration tests rather than the unit tests.

### Milestone vs sub-milestone checklist work

When working on checklist items organized into milestones, build and test only the
source-component in scope, not the entire repository.

To complete the milestone, perform the implicit end-of-milestone steps described under
"CHECKLIST file hygiene" above (clean repo-wide build with zero warnings, in-scope tests,
sync with origin and push).

### Unit tests

Unit tests should always be reproducible and not use random sampling techniques at runtime without the developer's explicit approval and then
it should be recorded in a design note.

### Integration tests

Integration tests should use larger scale data.

There is no required minimum, but in general should start with data volume in the hundreds or thousands.

The data does not have to be necessarily stable. A guideline might be that smaller data sets (<10kb) should be checked in whether in
a separate file or somehow encoded in source files. Larger data sets may be generated at run time, whether exhaustively or
via random techniques.

## Architectural pre-steps

**Never call `stdout`/`stderr`/`print`/`eprintln` (or the language equivalent) from
more than one site in a tool.** At the first occurrence, introduce an output
abstraction — a writer trait, a sink, or a formatter — and route every subsequent
output through it. The abstraction need not be elaborate (a single trait with one
`write_str` method, or a UTF-8 character stream, is enough); the requirement is that
the storage target (file, channel, stdout, stderr) and the formatting concern be
separable from the call sites that produce content.

This applies to any feature whose output may plausibly need to be retargeted later:
CLI output, log output, diagnostic output, generated artifacts.

<!-- tpu-mcp:setup:begin -->
## File I/O — use `tpu_*` MCP tools, never PowerShell or shell

This workspace runs the **tpu-mcp** MCP server which exposes encoding-aware
file primitives as first-class tools. Plain `Get-Content` / `Set-Content` /
`Out-File` / `>` / `cat` / `sed` round-trip files through the active code
page and silently corrupt UTF-8, UTF-16, smart quotes, em-dashes, and
box-drawing characters. Use the MCP tools instead — they detect, preserve,
and round-trip the file's native encoding and line endings safely.

**Rule:** when working in any project that has the tpu-mcp server registered,
ALWAYS prefer the `tpu_*` tools over PowerShell or shell file commands.

| MCP tool | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `tpu_read_file` | reading text files (UTF-8, UTF-16, Windows-1252, Shift-JIS, …) |
| `tpu_read_head` / `tpu_read_tail` | first/last N lines or bytes |
| `tpu_read_file_binary` | inspecting raw bytes of binary files |
| `tpu_read_file_escaped` | reading text as a single 7-bit-clean escaped line |
| `tpu_write_file` | replacing a text file's full contents |
| `tpu_append_file` | appending text to an existing file |
| `tpu_replace_in_file` | regex / fixed-string substitution (use `fixed_strings: true` for literal targets) |
| `tpu_edit_file` | targeted insert/delete/splice at known line numbers |
| `tpu_validate_file` | pre-flight assertion that a file is in the expected state |
| `tpu_count_file` | line / word / char / byte / pattern counts |
| `tpu_find` | encoding-aware grep across files and globs |
| `tpu_copy_file` | copy a file or recursively copy a tree (resilient: per-entry warnings, never aborts mid-walk by default) |
| `tpu_render_file` | populate a file from a `{{TOKEN}}` template |
| `tpu_stat_file` | verify a write actually persisted (mtime / size) |
| `tpu_setup` | (re)write this guidance block into the active `copilot-instructions.md` |

### When to use each

- **Reads** — always use `tpu_read_file`. Never use PowerShell `Get-Content`
  for code review or content inspection.
- **Edits** — prefer `tpu_replace_in_file` with `fixed_strings: true` over
  `tpu_edit_file` when the target text is unique, because line numbers can
  shift between reads. Use `tpu_edit_file` when you have just read the file
  and know exact line offsets.
- **Writes that should be guarded** — pass `validate: [{ "selector":
  "line-contains:N", "value": "..." }]` to refuse the write if the file is
  not in the expected state.
- **Globs / recursion** — `tpu_find` and `tpu_copy_file` accept glob
  patterns and tolerate inaccessible directories by emitting warning
  records (configurable via the `on_error` argument).
- **Dependency-free templating** — `tpu_render_file` substitutes
  `{{NAME}}`-style tokens. Use `\{{` to emit literal braces.

### File encoding

When you must fall back to PowerShell, never round-trip non-ASCII files
through `Get-Content` / `Set-Content` — read and write via
`[System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes` / `WriteAllBytes` and validate with
`tools/check-encoding.ps1` afterwards.
